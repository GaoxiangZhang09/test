                    <p>erracotta female figurines were uncovered by archaeologists in excavations of Mohenjo-daro, <br>
                        Pakistan (3000–1500 BC). Along with phallus-shaped stones, these suggest some sort of 
                        fertility cult.[15] The Burney Relief is an outstanding terracotta plaque from Ancient Mesopotamia 
                        of about 1950 BC. In Mesoamerica, the great majority of Olmec figurines were in terracotta. 
                        Many ushabti mortuary statuettes were also made of terracotta in Ancient Egypt.</p>

                    <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) <br>
                        strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of <br>
                        San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying <br>
                        both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and <br>
                        bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Being declared one of the <br>
                        Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers,[7] the bridge is one of <br>
                        the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It was initially <br>
                        designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. The bridge was named for the Golden Gate strait, <br>
                        the channel that it spans.</p>
